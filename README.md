# Keyword Counter

_Keyword Counter_ provides statistics on the use of words and phrases. This looks at the most used groups of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 phrases. Now you can understand if the content you are generating is reinforcing a common theme. For instance, if you were hoping to talk about fitness and weight loss but seem to continue to most frequently use unrelated words.. it might be a sign that you should revisit the main theme of each paragraph.
